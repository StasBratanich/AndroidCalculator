Android Calculator
This Android Calculator app provides basic arithmetic calculations and supports parentheses for complex expressions. The app is built using Android Studio and Java. It features a clean user interface with a text input area for numerical expressions, a result display, and buttons for numbers, operators, and special functions.

Features
Arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.
Support for parentheses: Users can input complex mathematical expressions with parentheses.
Error handling: The app gracefully handles errors, such as division by zero or invalid input.
Backspace functionality: Users can delete the last character entered.
Clear all (CE) functionality: Clears both the input and result areas.
Decimal point support: Users can input decimal numbers.
Usage
Numeric Input: Tap on numeric buttons to input numbers. The input is displayed in the top area.
Operator Input: Tap on operator buttons (+, -, X, /, %) to input operators. The input is visually separated by spaces.
Parentheses: Use the parentheses button to include parentheses in expressions.
Equals (=) Button: Calculates the result of the expression and displays it in the result area.
Backspace (DEL) Button: Removes the last entered character from the input.
Clear All (CE) Button: Clears both the input and result areas.
Decimal Point (.): Adds a decimal point to the numeric input.
Mathematical Expression Evaluation
The app uses a custom algorithm to evaluate mathematical expressions. It employs a stack-based approach to handle operators and operands, supporting the order of operations and parentheses.
